# Lekking as collective behaviour

Code and data for agent based model and preliminary blackbuck data analysis for the paper: Akanksha Rathore, Kavita Isvaran, Vishwesha Guttal, Lekking as Collective Behaviour, In Revision. 

## Figure 2A and B: Agent-based model results.

To reproduce results of agent-based model shown in Figure 2A and 2B of the paper, please download and run the code Figure2.R. You need to have installed R and RStudio on your computer and must be familiar about using R. Since the simulations are based on a stochastic agent-based model, you will not see figure identical to those shown in the figure. There will be variation in the figure, especially in Figure 2B, between each run. 

In the animations, we display sample trajectories for these possibilities, demonstrating that in the case of the social interaction model, we are likely to observe clustered departures towards the foraging site.

### Without social interactions -- random departures

### With social coying interaction -- synchronized departures
